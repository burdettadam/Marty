# Inspection System Architecture

## Overview
The Inspection System verifies the authenticity and integrity of ePassports. It reads and validates chip data, ensuring compliance with ICAO standards.

## Responsibilities
- Read MRZ and derive access keys (BAC/PACE).
- Access and parse chip data (DGs and SOD).
- Validate signatures against trusted CSCA certificates.
- Check revocation status using CRLs.

## Key Features
- Integration with the Trust Anchor Management service for CSCA validation.
- Support for BAC, PACE, and EAC protocols.
- High accuracy and reliability in passport verification.

## Technologies
- JMRTD for LDS handling and inspection.
- OpenSSL or BouncyCastle for cryptographic operations.
- TLS/HTTPS for secure communication.

## Data Flow
1. Read MRZ and derive access keys.
2. Access and parse chip data.
3. Validate SOD signatures against trusted CSCA certificates.
4. Check revocation status using CRLs.

## Deployment
- Deploy on secure, redundant infrastructure.
- Regularly update trusted CSCA lists and CRLs.
- Optimize performance for real-time verification.
