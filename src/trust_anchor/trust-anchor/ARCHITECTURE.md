# Trust Anchor Management Architecture

## Overview
The Trust Anchor Management service maintains trusted CSCA certificate lists and synchronizes with the ICAO PKD or private mirrors. It ensures the availability of up-to-date certificate and revocation information.

## Responsibilities
- Maintain and update trusted CSCA certificate lists.
- Synchronize with ICAO PKD or private mirrors.
- Manage Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

## Key Features
- Integration with other services for certificate validation.
- High availability and reliability for certificate updates.
- Compliance with ICAO Doc 9303 standards.

## Technologies
- OpenSSL or BouncyCastle for cryptographic operations.
- TLS/HTTPS for secure communication.
- XMLDSIG/CMS for digital signatures.

## Data Flow
1. Synchronize with ICAO PKD or private mirrors.
2. Update trusted CSCA certificate lists.
3. Publish updated CRLs to other services.

## Deployment
- Deploy on secure, redundant infrastructure.
- Regularly update trusted CSCA lists and CRLs.
- Monitor and respond to synchronization issues promptly.
