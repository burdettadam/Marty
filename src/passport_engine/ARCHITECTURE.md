# Passport Personalization Engine Architecture

## Overview
The Passport Personalization Engine generates the Logical Data Structure (LDS) for ePassports and produces the complete eMRTD chip content. It integrates with the Document Signer Service for signing operations.

## Responsibilities
- Generate LDS data groups (e.g., DG1 for MRZ, DG2 for photo).
- Create and format eMRTD chip content.
- Ensure compliance with ICAO Doc 9303 standards.

## Key Features
- Integration with the Document Signer Service for SOD signing.
- Support for ICAO-compliant eMRTD chip content.
- Scalability to handle high-volume passport personalization.

## Technologies
- JMRTD for LDS handling.
- OpenSSL or BouncyCastle for cryptographic operations.
- ASN.1 for binary data encoding.

## Data Flow
1. Generate LDS data groups.
2. Format eMRTD chip content.
3. Send SOD files to the Document Signer Service for signing.

## Deployment
- Deploy on secure, redundant infrastructure.
- Optimize cryptographic operations for scalability.
- Regularly update software to support new eMRTD standards.
