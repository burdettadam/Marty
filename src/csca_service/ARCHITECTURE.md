# CSCA Management Service Architecture

## Overview
The CSCA Management Service is a critical component of the passport issuance system. It is responsible for managing the Country Signing Certificate Authority (CSCA), which is the root of trust in the ICAO PKI model.

## Responsibilities
- Generate and securely store CSCA private keys.
- Issue and publish CSCA certificates.
- Sign Document Signer Certificates (DSCs).
- Manage certificate lifecycles, including renewal and revocation.

## Key Features
- Integration with Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for secure key storage.
- Compliance with ICAO Doc 9303 standards.
- High availability and scalability to support national-level operations.

## Technologies
- OpenSSL or BouncyCastle for cryptographic operations.
- TLS/HTTPS for secure communication.
- X.509/RFC 5280 for certificate management.

## Data Flow
1. Generate CSCA private keys and certificates.
2. Sign DSCs for the Document Signer Service.
3. Publish CSCA certificates to the Trust Anchor Management service.

## Deployment
- Use HSMs for key storage.
- Deploy on secure, redundant infrastructure.
- Regularly update trusted CSCA lists and CRLs.
