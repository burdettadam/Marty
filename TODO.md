# How to Contribute to Marty

We welcome contributions to the Marty project! To ensure code quality and maintainability, please follow these guidelines:

*   **Code Quality:** We use Ruff for code quality checks, including complexity. Ensure your code passes these checks before submitting.
*   **Development Process:**
    1.  **API Design:** Structure your APIs thoughtfully.
    2.  **Limited Responsibility Models:** Design models with clear and limited responsibilities.
    3.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests first.
    4.  **Passing Tests:** Implement code to make tests pass by following defined algorithms. Do not hardcode return types merely to satisfy tests.
*   **Debugging and Refactoring:**
    *   When a test fails, first try to reduce the complexity of the failing code.
    *   Create new tests for any refactored code.
    *   Add logging to understand errors before changing the code's algorithm.
*   **Pythonic Solutions:** We favor idiomatic Python solutions.
