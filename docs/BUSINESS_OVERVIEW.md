# Marty Educational Portfolio - Business Overview

**Educational Implementation of Secure Digital Identity Document Management**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY** - This project is developed for learning ICAO standards and portfolio demonstration purposes. Not intended for production use.

## Project Context

This is an **educational portfolio project** designed to demonstrate understanding of:
- ICAO international standards (Doc 9303, ISO/IEC 18013-5)
- Microservices architecture patterns
- Cryptographic implementations and PKI systems
- Modern software development practices

**This implementation is for learning purposes only and should never be used in production environments.**

## Key Business Benefits

### üîí **Enhanced Security**

- Enterprise-grade OpenXPKI integration

### üì± **Modern Digital Experience**
- Mobile-first document formats (mDL, DTC)
- Contactless verification via NFC/QR codes
- Seamless integration with existing systems
- User-friendly digital wallet compatibility

### üåç **International Compliance**
- Full ICAO Doc 9303 compliance for passports
- ISO/IEC 18013-5 standard for mobile licenses
- Interoperable with global verification systems
- Future-proof architecture for emerging standards

### üí∞ **Cost Efficiency**
- Reduced physical document production costs
- Automated certificate lifecycle management
- Scalable cloud-native architecture
- Lower operational overhead through automation

## Document Types Supported

| Document Type | Standard | Use Cases |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| **Electronic Passports (eMRTD)** | ICAO Doc 9303 | Border control, international travel verification |
| **Mobile Driving Licenses (mDL)** | ISO/IEC 18013-5 | Traffic stops, age verification, identity proof |
| **Digital Travel Credentials (DTC)** | ICAO DTC | Streamlined border processing, travel facilitation |
| **Mobile Documents (mDoc)** | ISO/IEC 18013-5 | General identity documents, permits, licenses |

## Architecture Benefits
